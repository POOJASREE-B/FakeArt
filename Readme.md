### 🎨 FakeArt – AI vs Real Image Detector
## 🧠 What is FakeArt?
FakeArt is a lightweight AI-powered tool that helps you determine whether an artwork or image is human-made or AI-generated. With the increasing use of generative AI tools in digital art, it’s becoming difficult to identify authentic human creativity. This tool brings transparency to the digital art world by offering trustworthy, explainable predictions.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Detects if an image was created by a human or generated by an AI


📊 Shows prediction confidence with a visual score


🧩 Explainable predictions 


🖼️ Supports JPG, PNG, and WebP image uploads


💡 Clean, responsive UI with one-click predictions (built in Streamlit)

## 🖼️ Example Output
Uploaded Image	                       Prediction	    Confidence
Van Gogh-style portrait	🎨             Human-Made	      92.3%
Unrealistically smooth anime art	🤖   AI-Generated	    97.1%

## 🏗️ How It Works

1.Upload an image (artwork, painting, illustration, etc.)


2.The system extracts key visual features from the image (textures, patterns, brush stroke style, color distribution, etc.)


3.A trained classification model evaluates the image and determines whether it matches typical AI-generated or real-human patterns.


4.You receive a clear label: "Human-Made" or "AI-Generated", along with the confidence percentage.

## 💻 Tech Stack


Frontend: Streamlit for fast and interactive web app


Backend: Python with Transformers and Image Classification pipeline


Model Type: Deep learning image classifier fine-tuned to distinguish human vs AI-generated patterns

## 🔍 Future Improvements


Add support for multi-class detection (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, Midjourney vs. Real)


Integrate with NFT verification tools


Offer batch image classification


Add watermark detection for AI art
